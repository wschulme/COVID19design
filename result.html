      <h2 id = "warning">PLEASE NOTE: Homemade devices are not as effective as professionally made equipment. Commercial masks meet regulatory guidelines, but homemade masks may not. Homemade masks are to be used at your own risk and do not guarantee that you will not fall ill. These masks are also not meant to replace other prevention methods such as social distancing or other CDC guidelines. If you are sick or otherwise vulnerable, please visit the CDC website, linked below, to find your best course of action. When employing reusable face masks as a means of protection against droplets, there is a significant risk of contaminants or pathogens getting caught in the mask itself. Therefore, cleaning between uses is absolutely essential. Follow the directions given with each mask.
